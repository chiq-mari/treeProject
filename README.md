## Final Project Dynamic Data Structures (college course):
  *_Family tree for Descendants in a Kingdom_*

## Description: 
  The following program keeps track of the descendants in a family from the first king in a kingdom.
In it, each king can produce a maximum of two heirs, and the rule that the firstborn always inherits
the throne must be followed, unless there are no more, and the crown must be passed on to the second-born sons
in the kingdom.

## Implementation

  To register descendants, each person is entered into a binary tree, where the root is the first King in the
history of the Kingdom.

This program allows:
  - Add new descendants to the tree
  - Modify the data of the nodes (people) in the tree.
  - Show who the current King is and update it if any change occurs.
  - Show the current line of succession to the crown.
